'''
This is the first child program called by the main program. The purpose of this program is to create
synthetic patient data. It uses the faker library to generate the synthetic data. In its current form
the data generates a random, unique patient id, and a few general starting vitals. The DataFrame that
is generated is then stored in a CSV. The CSV is used by the next program (generate_health_data).

'''The funtion to generate the synthetic patient data. It uses faker to create the data, and can be
reconfigured to accommodate a different set up patient data as desired. However, you will need to
make sure that a patient id is created since it will be required by the generate_health_data to
create the synthetic health data.'''
